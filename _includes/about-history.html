          SHPE at Prairie View A&amp;M University has a legacy rooted in resilience,
          leadership, and service. A SHPE chapter was first loosely chartered during the
          1995 academic year by student leaders Daniel Alcantar (President), Jose Luna
          (Vice President), and Vicente Rodriguez (Secretary), who organized early
          fundraisers and helped establish a space for Hispanic engineers and allies within
          the College of Engineering. Due to limited membership, the chapter became
          inactive in 1997.

          In Fall 2009, the chapter was revitalized through the drafting of new bylaws—an
          effort supported by Dr. Felecia Nave and the Roy G. Perry College of
          Engineering—which helped set a renewed foundation for long-term growth and
          continuity. The PVAMU SHPE Student Chapter was officially recognized by SHPE
          National on October 2, 2010, and was re-founded under the leadership of
          Electrical Engineering major Debbie Zepeda (President, 2009–2010). Since then,
          PVAMU SHPE has remained committed to developing students into strong engineers
          and professionals by providing opportunities for corporate networking, technical
          and career-focused workshops, mentorship, tutoring, and campus engagement.
        </p>

          Over the years, the chapter has also contributed to the Prairie View community
          through service and outreach initiatives, reflecting SHPE's broader mission of
          uplifting and advancing the next generation. Like many student-led organizations,
          PVAMU SHPE has experienced seasons of higher activity and seasons of
          rebuilding—yet in recent years, the chapter has continued moving forward with
          renewed momentum, guided by lessons from the past and a focus on sustainable
          leadership. Today, PVAMU SHPE remains dedicated to building a welcoming,
          high-impact community that supports members academically, professionally, and
          personally—while creating pathways for success in STEM and beyond.
